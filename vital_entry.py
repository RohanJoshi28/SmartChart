        prompt='''For the following string of vitals, ONLY return a modified string of vitals that has the vitals in their isolated form. DO NOT INCLUDE vitals not 
            explicitly written in the input. Note that the avpu vital has to do with any text concerning patient consciousness or patient responsiveness. For lung sounds please only report one word. 
            
            For example, an input of:
            
            "The patient's name is Bob Smith, who is a 60 years old male and lives at 123 main Street. His chief complaint is chest pain. He describes this pain as crushing. 
            He is alert, and his gcs is 15. The patient has a pulse of 60 beats per minute, their pupils are pinpoint, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per second, 
            and a blood pressure of 160 over 80. Oxygen saturation is 95% and the temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Provider names 
            are Moe and Christine, and patient was transported to Hackensack Hospital." 
            
            Should have an output of:

            "name:Bob Smith; age:60; gender:male; address:123 Main Street; chief_complaint: headache; opqrst:crushing; avpu:alert; glasgow_coma_scale:15; pupils:pinpoint; pulse_rate:60; respiratory_rate:17; blood_pressure:160/80; pulse_ox:95; temperature:98.6; provider_names:Moe and Christine; receiving_facility:Hackensack Hospital;". 
            
            Include no units in your response. Furthermore, your response MAY ONLY use the following vitals, although you probably will not use all of them: 
            name, age, address, gender chief complaint, avpu, glasgow_coma_scale, pulse_rate, respiratory_rate, blood_pressure, pulse_ox, temperature, skin_condition, pupils, 
            breath_sounds, provider_names, and receiving_facility. If any vital given in the input doesn't math one of these vitals DO NOT INCLUDE. 
            Also, if there is no relevant input for any of the vitals, DO NOT INCLUDE THAT VITAL IN YOUR OUTPUT. DO NOT INCLUDE any text not in the form of <vital_name>:<vital>. 
            You have failed the task if there is any text that is not in the form of <vital_name>:<vital_input>, or if you present any information not explicitly contained in the input.

            For example, if my input is only:
            "The patient's name is Sally Smith, she is female they have a glasgow coma scale score of 12, and they have a pulse of 100. Their skin has urticaria."

            The output should ONLY contain (with no additional text):
            "name:Sally Smith; gender:female; glasgow_coma_scale:12; pulse_rate:100; skin_condition:urticaria"

            Here is one last example:
            Input: "Ems arrived at 12:30am. The patient is a man who has a blood pressure of 130 over 80, and responds to pain. They have a pulse ox of 98, and breath sounds of rales."
            Output: "gender:male; arrival_time:12.30am; blood_pressure:130/80; avpu:pain; pulse_ox:98; breath_sounds:rales"

            Here is the input string: '''  + replaced,
